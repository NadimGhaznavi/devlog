# Engineering Contract

**The smallest clear implementation that satisfies the contract wins.** BMForge is for the applications actually being built, not an imagined enterprise platform.

## Required behaviour

1. **Implement only requested capability.** Reuse the chosen patterns and the project's existing conventions. Do not add generic frameworks, brokers, caches, background supervisors, feature switches, or other infrastructure without a concrete requirement.
2. **Validate at trust boundaries.** Check untrusted network input, configuration, credentials and external protocol messages at entry. Reject invalid external requests predictably. Do not duplicate those checks throughout trusted internal code.
3. **Trust internal contracts.** Once an invariant or validated contract is established, rely on it. An impossible internal state is a defect, not an invitation to manufacture a fallback.
4. **Fail fast and visibly.** Missing required resources, invalid startup configuration, failed binds, and broken internal invariants should produce an actionable error and stop the affected operation or service. Never fabricate success.
5. **Handle real distributed failures.** For required remote operations, use the necessary timeout, acknowledgement, and error reporting. Recovery and retries must be explicit, bounded, and justified by the operation's semantics, not added reflexively.
6. **Catch exceptions only to act.** Handle a known external error, release owned resources, add useful context, or perform specified recovery. Otherwise let it propagate. Do not blanket-catch exceptions, silently swallow errors, or return fake defaults.
7. **Test contracts, not speculation.** Verify normal behaviour, named acceptance checks, meaningful trust-boundary failures, and required startup/shutdown conditions. Keep tests proportional to the component.
8. **Classify by responsibility.** Follow [Activity / Interface / Entity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classification.md %}): interface classes bridge technology or domain data access, activity classes orchestrate application operations, and entities hold values. Do not blend SQL, workflow and entity state into one class.
9. **Preserve approved runtime choices.** Component module inventories are binding. [Display visualization choices]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/component-visualization.md %}) are likewise fixed by actual chart, map or graph requirements, not by Codex preferences. Do not replace or add infrastructure libraries, drivers or frameworks to solve a task without user approval and an updated component specification. Configure the known pattern rather than re-architecting it.

## What failure should look like

| Situation | Contract-driven response |
| --- | --- |
| Public HTTP client sends malformed JSON | Return a clear 4xx response; keep serving valid requests. |
| Required HTTP port is already occupied | Report the bind error and abort startup. |
| Internal code violates an established invariant | Raise a meaningful error; don't continue with guessed values. |
| Required ZeroMQ exchange times out | Report failure to the caller; retry only if the application contract explicitly permits it. |
| Database transaction fails | Roll back that transaction and propagate the error; never report a successful commit. |

A health check reports actual application state; it is not a mandate to build a self-healing system. Follow [Application Health Checks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/health-checks.md %}): one existing interface, no monitoring background workers, and no direct CMDB-to-MariaDB probe. Security at exposed boundaries is mandatory where applicable, but redundant internal validation is not security.

Every new project must also satisfy the [Installation Lifecycle contract]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/component-installation.md %}): install, upgrade and uninstall must work for the application's actual distribution topology. A successful install leaves a readable version/ownership record under its application-owned `/opt/prod` directory. Bootstrapped deployment stubs are **not proof** that the app can be installed.

## Scope gate for Codex

Before adding nontrivial defensive logic or an additional layer, identify **the requirement or observed failure it solves**. If none exists, omit it. Prefer an understandable, observable failure over code that quietly limps forward.

The [component blueprints]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/component-blueprints.md %}) define specific behaviours; [CMDB compliance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/cmdb-compliance.md %}) and the other existing processes govern deployment. A component skill must follow this contract, not replace it.
